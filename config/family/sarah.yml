    content: |
        You were the part of my life I was missing<br>
        The unexpected, the enigma I needed<br>
        A force of nature that I was besotted by<br>
        Underneath seeking a soul mate.<br>
        <br>
        The connection we had, was instant<br>
        The brash London girl, with flare<br>
        And the village lad, in Lonsdale shoes<br>
        Not meant to work, but very much did.<br>
        <br>
        You were only supposed to stay for a day<br>
        Ended up spending your life with me<br>
        So many amazing and awful memories<br>
        But through it all, you were you.<br>
        <br>
        Where ever we went, people were drawn to you<br>
        You had a special personality which will be absent<br>
        An ability to put people at ease, making you loved<br>
        and incredibly missed.<br>
        <br>
        So very strong and full of fight, you inspired me<br>
        Always meet challenges head on, no compromise<br>
        Fighting, laughing, right to the end, an inspiration<br>
        Rest now my love, out of pain and in my heart.

    title: Chapter 1 - The Wedding
    author: Martyn Fitzmaurice

        Our wedding day was one of the best days of my life, I had found the most amazing person. To say I was nervous was an understatement, I dropped my niece off at Sarah’s house and her dad was really worried, he even told Sarah that he hadn't seen me like that before. The nerves were there as I was totally in love and convinced myself she would realise that she was way out of my league.<br>
        I needn’t have been worried, Sarah turned up early, I was still with the registrar when she arrived. That still didn't stop me from thinking that she would get to the end of the aisle and decide that it wasn't for her!!<br>
        Again, I shouldn't have worried.<br>
        Sarah was stunning, I stood there mesmerised by how truly beautiful she was that day. Standing there looking at her, I promised to love her for the rest of my life. Not knowing that we didn't have as much time as we had hoped to be together. The rest of the day went by like a whirlwind, we ate, drank, danced and laughed. So much love in that room from everyone there, it was the start of an amazing journey that was too short. But I can honestly say that our life together was never boring and these are the memories of that life together.<br>
        Some great memories were made that day, not just our marriage. I returned my nephews shirt that had half a field up the sleeves, I honestly thought they would charge me extra for the cleaning. The ‘dislocator’ was born, only to have a sequel the following week, those that know, know! Anne ended up in A&E with a suspected heart attack, only for it to be the pants she wore were too tight. My dad found one of my friends asleep in a hedge, emotional trauma for my niece seeing my Staff Sargeant swapping clothes with my usher’s girlfriend in the women’s toilet, finally there were the toasters.<br>
        One of Sarah's friends thought it would be really funny for all of her friends to get us toasters as wedding gifts. After unwrapping three toasters, Sarah's comment was "If the next present is a Fucking Toaster, I'm going to kill someone!" When we (Sarah) had finished unwrapping all the presents, we had seven new toasters and a toaster that had been found in a skip and painted (Thanks Jogi).<br>
        In the morning Sarah and I went down for breakfast, we noticed that one of my Army friends was arguing with Staff and his girlfriend. It turns out, one of the other female guests had managed to convince the staff that she was his girlfriend and got a second key to their room. She then proceeded to put lots of drinks on his room!! He obviously thought his girlfriend had done this and was pissed. Such good times, and don’t trust military people when it comes to drinks.<br>
        I have such fond memories of that day, it was the longest and shortest day of my life. Thought it would never end and it was over in a flash. Sarah always said we would recreate the day and do it all again. I was planning on surprising her one day with it, but that wasn't meant to be.<br>
        We were only together for two years prior to getting married, but as people say, when you know you know. I knew fairly early on that she was the one, remembering the time we had together our dating and engaged years were really special for many reasons.

    title: Chapter 2 - How we met and getting up the Aisle
    author: Martyn Fitzmaurice
    content: |
        We met on Facebook, they had an app in the early days called Zoosk. It created a little dating profile and I put in a wide search. Her profile jumped out to me, as she was very striking, I sent her a 'wink' and asked how she was. Then I waited, and waited and finally about a month later I got a reply. Sarah was very sorry it took so long, as she was in a car accident and had broken her ankle, or so I thought for all these years. Anne informed me that she broke her ankle whilst she was slightly inebriated watching the London Marathon at her flat near Tower Bridge. Which is an even better story and I’m so happy that I found that out.<br>
        For weeks after that first exchange, we chatted every day, constantly messaging, laughing and slowly getting to know each other. Then out of nowhere Sarah said she was going to come and see me. It was the Queen’s birthday weekend, Sarah came up on the Sunday, she wanted an escape route if she didn't like me. Picking her up from the train station was a mission, I waited on the side the train arrived at, but she didn't come out there. I called her and it kept going to voice mail, I thought she had stood me up. I drove round the other side of the station and there she was, chatting to a friend on the phone saying that she thought I had stood her up!!<br>
        Her intention was to stay the afternoon, have something to eat and see if we get on. She stayed until Tuesday, only going home at the last moment. I’m surprised she stayed, as when I found out she was a red head, being me, I called her a ‘Gwar’ to which she replied with a punch to my face. It was instant Love!! The following day Facebook informed me that I was in a relationship with the most amazing person<br>
        For the next six months we saw each other every weekend. About 2 months in, it was time for us to meet each other’s families. Sarah came to Cromer with me to meet my parents, we sat outside the Chalet drinking Cider and chatting with my mum and dad. They adored her from the start, she had the most amazing talent of personality to woo anyone. The next visit to my parents was at their home, we had Chinese and Sarah had a rib on her plate. My dad said "Is that one of my ribs"? Sarah said "Yes", to which he decided to call her a "Bastard" jokingly of course (I hope it was). I explained to her at the time that it means he liked her!<br>
        Then I went to London to meet her family and friends. This was a make-or-break weekend for us, as if Sarah's friends didn't like me, she would have to think again (So she said, but I didn't believe it).<br>
        I arrived Friday afternoon and got a hotel in Shoreditch, I called Sarah to let her know I had arrived and where to meet her after she finished work. She told me to come out the hotel turn right and head up to a bar called Browns. I did as I was told and headed there, when I got in there, I didn't notice anything unusual. I went to the bar and ordered a drink and was a little confused as to why my change came in all pound coins. The next thing I knew there was a tap on my shoulder, I turned around and there was a young girl with a pint glass asking for a pound. Turned out that the place Sarah said to meet her was a lap dancing club. Phoning Sarah and asking her what was going on she replied "I thought you would enjoy it in there!". That was another indicator that she was the one and how pretty fucking cool she was.<br>
        After we left Browns we went to the hotel to get ready to head over and see her friends, I had managed to get an executive room with access to the lounge. After we got ready, we went to the lounge and drank our body weight in free booze. We were a little squiffy when we headed over to meet her friends.<br>
        The Bermondsey Massive as they were known to me, were so very welcoming, as the new person it was fairly intimidating getting to know them all. This was the first hurdle and I managed to get through it, being accepted quickly as one of the gang, leading to many weekends in London with the crew.<br>
        Having survived the first task, we moved onto meeting her Mum and sister for lunch on the Sunday. This is where I would impress them and show them that I was perfect for Sarah and her for me. Everything was going fairly well until Sarah went to the toilet, we were ordering food and Rachel ordered but didn't say please. Channeling my inner mother I said to her "Please" with a raised eyebrow. I later found out that Rachel advised Sarah to get rid of me as I was a dick (Don’t know if this is true, but I like to think it is).<br>
        After this triumphant charm offensive, I was off to meet Sarah's Dad at his regular Sunday pub at the end of an all-day session. I politely introduced myself and engaged in small talk. After about 10mins of chit chat and me thinking we had bonded over the Deadliest Catch, I happened to mention that I would look after Sarah and take her out of London. You would have thought I had just punched him in the face. His whole attitude changed and pointing at me he said "You're not fucking taking her anywhere! If I had my way, she would stay at home all the time!". The fact I'm still here is a sign that he did end up liking me.<br>
        Luckily for me Sarah didn't listen and we carried on dating, I then got sent to Afghanistan on a six-month tour. This was another make-or-break trial for us both. She never failed to message me every day, sent me letters, welfare boxes and so much more. It was whilst I was back on R&R that I decided that I was going to ask her to marry me. While I was away, I had planned an amazing cruise for us both. As with everything else, Sarah took this and made it so much better, we would cruise from Southampton to New York on the Queen Mary 2, spend 4 days in New Jersey with friends, 4 days in Washington DC and 3 days in New York then flying home.<br>
        We didn’t expect the ship to be so big, when we entered the dock I thought it was a building, until I noticed that there were portholes in the wall. We were both gob smacked by it’s size and grandeur. We dropped our cases off and headed into the terminal, we sat down and Sarah was suitably excited and wanted a drink. We couldn’t see anywhere that was serving any drinks. I was looking on my phone, then Sarah shot up and informed me that she just saw someone with a beer.<br>
        She proceeded to practically run towards the first Cunard rep she could find. She asked the lady where the bar was as she wanted to get a drink, to which she got this reply. “Madam, embarkation is in 45 minutes, surely you can wait that long for a drink?”. Sarah walked back to me like she had been told off and sat down. When she told me what happened I did what any loving boyfriend would do, I laughed.<br>
        Sarah had a little bit of seasickness. The ship’s Doctor came to see her and decided to give her an injection to stop the nausea, which worked, but he put the needle into the bin in our cabin. When the cabin steward came to empty the bin, she asked us why there was a needle in the bin. I told her that the Doctor had put it in there.<br>
        She didn’t believe me, went and got a sharps box for the room and kept looking at me as if I was a drugs addict. No matter how many times we told her that the Doctor had left it. I was a little bit scared to go back to the cabin the rest of the trip in case they had the drugs squad in.<br>
        The night of the captain’s reception, I chose to propose. We were in the grand ballroom, all suited and booted and ready to go down on one knee in front of everyone. I decided to test the water before doing it, "What would you do if I proposed to you now?" I asked. "I would freak out, surrounded by strangers!". I slowly pushed the ring back into my pocket.<br>
        Walking around the ship the next day, trying to find somewhere quiet to ask her, the ring burning a hole in my pocket, we decided to go back to the cabin and I could come up with a better plan. As I was laying on the bed Sarah looked over and asked what was in my pocket! Not knowing what to do I said "Nothing!" then added "You might as well get it out!". Taking the box out and opening it I said "Well, do ya?", she looked at the plain silver band in the box and said "What?" So I explained that I wanted a ring to propose with and when we got to New York we could go and buy the ring together. When she realised she was getting Diamonds, she said "Yes"!<br>
        One of our most cherished memories comes from when we docked in New York. I was sitting on the balcony and Sarah was on the bed, we were waiting to be called forward to disembark the ship. We were just chatting, but we could hear the workers down below unloading the ship. There was a lot of commotion and then a booming NYC accent shouted out, “Hey, I’m fucking working here!”. Sarah loved it, commenting that was all she wanted to hear.<br>
        I let our friends in New Jersey know that we had got engaged, they met us at the port to take us to the hotel. But we insisted on going to the mall to get my mum a Yankee Candle. This was a trick, as my parents had flown out to meet up with us. The look on our friend Walt's face was priceless, I've never seen him speechless before or since.<br>
        We went to the hotel and the Americans had arrange for our room to be decorated with Engagement decorations. Then they held a BBQ party for us and we had an amazing time with them. We visited the Jersey shore and had an amazing time with them.<br>
        Sarah wanted to get a coat as she was finding it a little cold. So, we went to Walmart with my parents. This was Sarah’s first introduction to ‘Vanishing Val’. As we walked in, my Dad turned to Sarah and said “Don’t be surprised if Val disappears!”, Sarah thought it was my dad trying to wind her up, but he wasn’t. No more than two minutes in the shop, Sarah turned round to say something to my mum and found that she was missing. Luckily, it didn’t take long to find her, so we could get on with what we went in there for.<br>
        We were walking around for ages trying to find a coat, Sarah decided to ask one of the workers there. The next 10 minutes was as a classic example of the difference in understanding between Brits and Yanks. We were trying to explain that Sarah was after a Rain coat (Mac) to which the lady helping us said “I literally don’t understand the words you’re saying to me!”. She called a colleague over and she managed to translate what we were asking for as a ‘Wind Breaker’. We were shown where they were and after all that, Sarah didn’t want any of them!!<br>
        From there we got a train from New Jersey to Washington DC. You couldn't book tickets at the desk, you had to use a phone on the wall to get tickets. This resulted in my parents and us having different tickets, which resulted in Sarah and I getting kicked off the train to wait for the next train to come. Bloody Americans!!!<br>
        DC was fantastic, we saw so much and had some amazing food. Apart from one night, Sarah was desperate to have some seafood, so she took the recommendation of the tourist bus driver about a restaurant. We should have realised how bad it might be, when the taxi driver asked us if we were sure about going there. We went anyway, standing in a queue to get in, we noticed that the maître’d had some teeth missing. We came out of the restaurant and were in the middle of nowhere, with just a nightclub next door. We walked to try and find a busier road and luckily a taxi drove past and picked us up.<br>
        We travelled back to New York, my parents headed home whilst Sarah and I went to our final hotel for the final days in NYC. We checked in to the hotel and the cases hadn't even hit the floor before Sarah was dragging me to reception. When we got there Sarah was practically shouting at the guy behind the counter "Where's the Diamond District??"<br>
        Sarah found her ring in the first dealership we went into. It was a good exchange rate at the time so we managed to get a great deal, not that Sarah was helping me in the negotiations. The jeweller was showing us rings in the budget, but nothing was really appealing to Sarah. Then the jewellers daughter starting showing us more expensive ones, which he wasn't too happy about. Sarah found the ring she wanted but he was asking for more than I could afford. We were discussing price and to help me Sarah was saying "I love it, I love it!". In the end I had to drag her away, saying we couldn't afford it, Sarah was almost in tears. About 5 steps away heading to the next jeweller he called us back and did it for the better price.<br>
        We had planned a long engagement as I didn't know where I would be posted etc. So, we just discussed what we wanted and where we wanted to have the ceremony. I can't remember who had the idea about Eastbury Manor, but whoever it was, it was an awesome idea. It was my idea to have the reception in the hotel, Sarah was convinced it was hers! As her nan Beryl told me, you could never tell Sarah what to do, or make suggestions, she had to come up with it on her own. She never changed.<br>
        Three weeks before the wedding, questions were being asked about my suitability to be married to Sarah. Terry had already witnessed me dressed as a French maid on the stag do, but hadn't counted on this. Sarah and I had been out drinking for a fair few hours, we had gone back to her mum house where we were staying. Sarah wakes up to see me squatting in the corner of the room, "What are you doing?" she asked, to which I reply "What's it look like?", Screaming at me Sarah said "Not in here, go outside!" meaning go to the bathroom. In my drunken state, I decided to take this literally. I stormed out of the room, down the stairs and out the front door. As it was 3am, I wasn't wearing very much, as in nothing. Swaying side to side, stark bollock naked I proceeded to piss against the fence. From behind I heard Sarah shout "What are you doing?", to which I replied "You said go outside, so I did!". In the morning my soon to be father in law enquired about what was happening, apparently we had woken him up, he thought it was raining until the shouting.<br>
        So, where we were aiming for a 5yr engagement, only 9 months later we were heading down the aisle. In between our engagement and the wedding, we continued on with expanding Sarah's travels. From a girl who thought that Skegness was in Scotland to a world traveler.<br>
        Our flight was cancelled due to bad weather, Sarah was panicking as they had arranged us another flight to meet the ship later in the cruise. The reason for the panic was that the flight was longer, we tried to keep that information from Sarah, but the big mouth agent let it slip. We managed to get Sarah to board the plane, I was holding her hand the whole time. It looked like a four-hour hell ride for her, until they served food. We were on BA, so free food and drink and Sarah was ecstatic, think that was one of a few flights she actually enjoyed.<br>
        Our second cruise was around the Med with stops in Egypt, Greece and Israel. As with most of our cruises, we went with my parents. They were top tier on the cruise line, so we had dinner in the fancy restaurant, where Sarah saw then making ice cream at the table using liquid nitrogen.<br>
        Another highlight of this holiday was our excursion in Egypt, every stop we had Sarah got noticed by the locals. Blond hair, young and attractive was like a beacon to every man around. We had armed security on the trip and he was never more than 3m from her. Which made it feel like a really awkward date with a third wheel.<br>
        We were at the pyramids and Sarah was off with my mum, think they were having a cigarette! When they got back to us, mum proceeded to tell us that she had just been offered 300 camels for Sarah, but was trying to negotiate 500. My reaction to this was obvious, I asked “How much is a camel worth?”, “How much does it cost to keep a camel?” and do they deliver to the UK? Even the tour guide said to me “1 million camels is not enough for her!”.<br>
        Travelling became the greatest shared experiences we had. A lot of our fondest memories are of the places we've been, the people we've met and the experiences we've had.

      This is probably going to be the biggest part of our story, the thing we most enjoyed was travelling, seeing new places with our family and friends (Both existing and ones we made along the way). It won't be a day-by-day account of all of our travels, just some of the highlights and funny stories along the way.<br>
      Alcudia<br>
      Before the two cruises mentioned, I wanted to go away with Sarah before I went to Afghanistan. I didn't bother with travel agents; I just went online and found the cheapest deal I could. So, I booked us on a four-day trip to Alcudia. What a disaster from start to finish, which lead to never being asked to plan a holiday ever again!!<br>
      I travelled down to London on Friday night with our flights at stupid o'clock the next morning. I was one stop away from Kings Cross when I realised that I had left my passport on my desk where I had left it, so I wouldn't forget it. Two hours later, I was back in London ready for a drink and to get us away.<br>
      Sarah's friend Dan drove us to the airport, he's a good lad, telling us about the awesome date he had, I was too drunk and tired to actually care, but he was giving us a lift so I smiled. As some may know, Sarah isn't the best flyer, which has resulted in some funny and embarrassing situations. Luckily on this trip she wasn't that bad and the flight went off without any incidents.<br>
      When we landed, we found out that we were as far from the airport as you could possibly get, two hours to get there in a sweaty van without aircon. I was already getting it in the ear, looking back I think she was actually holding back! At the resort, it wasn't that bad apart from it was like being on the Jeremy Kyle show, domestic arguments and questionable taste in fashions.<br>
      We decided to try the local food, as we are both partial to Spanish food. We walked for hours to try and find an authentic restaurant. The first place we stopped at we asked if they did Paella, we got told no, but they do a good steak and chips! Other places we tried had fry-ups and burgers on the menu and we were lucky that we wouldn't miss Popstars either, as that was on everywhere.<br>
      This led Sarah to take the lead on every holiday after that, she would choose and I would pay! It became a very good system and one I think I'm going to miss terribly. Most of our travels were via cruises, we enjoyed all that they offered. Great food, entertainment, new places and great people. She also enjoyed beach holidays, me not so much, but it made her happy so I went along with it. Our first big beach holiday was to Barbados in 2014, our official honeymoon, 4 yrs after we got married.<br>
      Barbados<br>
      Barbados was amazing, we had great fun riding the tuk tuk buses (Pimped out minivans with extra seats); we had a day at sea on a Catamaran (waited on hand and foot), we went to Oistins for the Friday Fish Fry (Sarah said some of the best fish she had ever eaten) and the guided bus tour of the island that involved us drinking 100% proof rum out of freshly opened coconuts. Sarah loved it there so much that we went back 4yrs later and had the adventure again.<br>
      Our return trip to Barbados, like most things, wasn't as good as the first time. We had the option to upgrade our flights to Upper Class, so we took that. The only thing that was any good on that flight was the airport lounge. They had managed to seat us on opposite sides of the plane, which did get sorted. I then found some used PJs from the previous flight and the service was super slow, not what you expect in Upper Class. When we got back Sarah went into full complaints mode, this I will discuss later as there are many, many incidents of Sarah complaining.<br>
      Japan<br>
      Two of our best cruise adventures have been to the far east. We went to Japan to do a cruise around the southern ports. When we arrived in Tokyo Sarah realised that the months of planning she had done for the three days in Tokyo weren't in her suitcase, but on the bedroom floor where she had left them. This slowed her down by about 30mins, she scowered her emails and penciled together the itinerary from that. My parents had joined us on this cruise as Japan was somewhere they had always wanted to go.<br>
      We found a great little diner across from the hotel we were staying at, that did western food as well as Japanese. This was handy for us as some in the party aren't that fond of the local cuisine. One night Dad as he does where ever he travels decided that he and I will head to KFC (You have to try it in different places). This was during the tail end of the Typhoon and we trudged through the wind and rain to get the chicken. We got soaked, but it was worth it to see the look on my Dad’s face.<br>
      One of the best things on her planned events was a day at a shopping mall. But, it consisted of a walking food tour of Japan. We visited different shops in the mall that had different foods from all around Japan. One of the stops was at a sweet potato shop, but they had molasses candied sweet potato fries. I was very skeptical, but they amazing and at one point all four of us were huddled around the pack stuffing our faces.<br>
      The pinnacle of the day was when Sarah went to the toilet, the rest of us were waiting outside and then an alarm went off in the toilet. Sarah came out just before the 70 year old security guy turned up, with what looked like a Batman utility belt on. The poor bloke was shattered from hurrying to rescue whoever was in danger.<br>
      Turns out it was Sarah who pressed the alarm and ran out before the guy got there. Sarah explained to us that she thought it was the flush as there weren’t any other buttons (motion sensors). She also explained that she had to lift up a plastic cover and press the bright RED button. We were all in tears laughing at that. Until the poor security man came out, he looked like he was about to have a heart attack. Needless to say, we slowly turned around and crept away before anything else happened.<br>
      Sarah the adventurer one night wanted to sample some food at a restaurant that was full of locals. Venturing into a little back-alley Sarah found a chicken restaurant where no one spoke any English. They did manage to find us an English menu, so we sat on a bank of tables and tried to decide what we wanted. Luckily for us a woman sitting next to us was Japan Air stewardess and spoke English. She kept passing us her food to try and if we liked it, she would order it for us. We discovered sweetcorn puffed fritters there, which were a taste sensation. When we left the restaurant, the owner came out to us to thank us for visiting his restaurant and presented us with fans. That was how Sarah was, drawing people to her everywhere she went.<br>
      Sarah and I then ventured out on our own and found a pork restaurant beneath the Tokyo rail station. It was a very eclectic menu, with the highlight being the Fried Rectum!! It was very chewy and that is all I’m going to say about that. We also went to several of the tranquil gardens around there too, they were so peaceful considering they were in Tokyo, Sarah was happiest there, I know because she wasn’t moaning.<br>
      Then we got the news that the ship was delayed by a day because of a Typhoon in the ships path. Several emails and evening phone calls to the cruise company, we managed to get an extra night in the hotel and they arranged for different flights back for us. This gave us an extra day to explore Tokyo before the real fun of the cruise.<br>
      The cruise was supposed to have 5 stops in seven days. This was changed less than 24hrs of being on the ship, a super typhoon was heading straight for us and would hit in two days if we had stayed on the original course. So, they changed the itinerary and we had two quick stops in Koba and Osaka before we headed for safety in the Yellow Sea for 4 days. We had the option to get off in Osaka, but it was a national holiday, every hotel was booked and we couldn’t get a flight home before the storm. So, we stayed aboard and we were refunded all our money for the cruise which led to our cruise around the Caribbean!<br>
      Sarah didn’t have the best sea legs on that cruise. We got some fairly big swells that rocked the ship, this didn’t go down to well with Sarah, which meant I had to hear about it. To make matters worse, I was fine, slept through most of the rough bits. But, as with everything, if Sarah was awake, I had to be awake.<br>
      That was a great introduction to Japan and Asia and led to a complete love of the culture and region for both of us. Sarah always said that she was born in the wrong country and that she was Japanese at heart and wanted me to work there, so we could live there.<br>
      Caribbean<br>
      This was a very memorable cruise for lots of reasons, mostly down to the terrible sisters and their poor husbands that were the blight of the cruise. As per usual we went on this cruise with my parents, with my mum delivering some absolute classic put downs to the sisters.<br>
      We were waiting to get some food at the hotel the night before the cruise and there were the sisters in front of us, complaining about everything. I’ve never rolled my eyes so much in my life, I said to Sarah “Knowing our luck, we will have them on our table for dinner!” giggling to myself. I wish I could of seen my face, when the first night at dinner, the annoying sisters walk in and head straight to our table.<br>
      This led to 6 out of 7 nights of moaning, rudeness and complaints. Here some of the highlights from the dinners. They didn’t fancy anything on the menu, so ordered some chips, when they came they were slightly cold (they talked to the waiter like shit for this) so decided to go to the buffet for food, we found out the next night that they made themselves cheese sandwiches<br>
      One night they were saying about all the cruises they have been on and that they were seasoned cruisers. They had done about 16 cruises, to which my mum turns round and says “We did nine last year!”. The look on their faces was hilarious and to make it even better we also got on the subject of how much we paid. One of the husbands got so upset that they had paid twice as much as us because his wife always went through the cruise company site rather than shopping around. They almost had an argument at the table, until she shut him down.<br>
      I managed to upset them as I got onboard spend, she was explaining to me that she tried every trick in the book to get some free onboard spend. Looking down her nose at me she asked “How did you get it?”, I told her that I was in the military and they gave me some onboard spend for my service. She wasn’t happy with that, as she couldn’t use it to get free credit<br>
      Another time they were telling us about when some Asians moved into their street, they wanted to have a look and see how they had decorated their homes (Who does that!!). So, they lied to them and said they were thinking about doing their own houses up and barged their way in. Absolutely mental<br>
      As they were cruise ‘pros’ they didn’t do formal night, so this was the one night we didn’t have to put up with any of them. It was the best night of the cruise, the food was amazing, the conversation was whinge free and the serving staff were in a great mood.<br>
      The Grand Asia Tou<br>
      This cruise is the one I hold closest to my heart, this was the longest cruise we had been on, on our own. I found the cruise which had a deal on flights, managed to get return flights for £49. As soon as I told Sarah the cost of this 19 night cruise, we booked it there and then. Only problem we had was that I was due posting at the time and had to negotiate the time off. Luckily I had retention leave, which can’t be denied, so I used most of that to get the time off.<br>
      Being in the Army, didn’t help with my application for a Visa. We started our cruise in Beijing, with other stops in Shanghai and Hong Kong. According to the booking details we had to get a multi-visit visa to ensure that we had seamless entry. When my visa came through it was for single entry only, which meant that I would not be able to get off at Shanghai or Hong Kong.<br>
      We called the embassy to see if this could be changed, they said NO!! We then contacted Princess and they got in contact with the Ship to enquire about what can be done. Luckily, this is a common issue, they applied for 72hr tourist visas on my behalf, which meant I could get off the ship and visit these places.<br>
      Day came to fly out to China for the start of our cruise, through a friend I had managed to get us an upgrade to Premium Economy. Remember Sarah isn’t a great flyer, so we took advantage of another friend connection to get a discount at Fortnum and Mason’s oyster bar at Heathrow. Sarah definitely took advantage of the cheaper Champagne. She was slightly squiffy by the time we boarded the plane. I spoke to the air stewardess and she seated us in Premium Economy.<br>
      Unfortunately, we were not sitting next to each other. Being a British Airways flight, free booze, which Sarah continued to take advantage of. About an hour into the flight Sarah had to go to the toilet as she had been a little sick down herself. It was at this point, the stewardess asked me if we would be more comfortable at the back of the plane where they could keep an eye on us. I wasn’t very happy, but I went with her and that was a very interesting rest of the flight. Sarah had to go to the toilet a few times to be sick. She then decided that she felt better laying on the floor of the plane in front of the toilet, to go to sleep. That’s one of the only times I lost my cool with her and told her to get up and sit in our seats.<br>
      Finally, Sarah settled down and went to sleep. As she was asleep, I decided to get a few winks too. I was awoken about 20mins later by Sarah insisting that I remain awake, as she felt ‘safer’ knowing I was awake. So, for the remaining 7 hours I vigilantly kept watch over the vomit-stained wife.<br>
      We had three nights in Beijing before the cruise, that was a very interesting place, we needed our passports to get onto public transport. We had to be searched before we got onto the platform and we were followed the whole time we were there. In the security brief I had before leaving, I was assured that our room would be bugged. Sarah and I had great fun walking around the room saying things like “It’s a shame we won’t be able to come back after we invade!”.<br>
      The last day we had before we got on the ship was also eventful, this time it was my fault. We got back from a long day of walking around Beijing, Sarah was shattered so had crashed out on the bed. We had been told that our cases needed to be downstairs with the rep before 10pm, so they could be taken to ship for us. As Sarah was sleeping, but still awake enough to scream at me when I asked her to pack her case, I packed them and took them down.<br>
      At about 10:15pm, I realised that I had packed the passports and tickets in one of the suitcases. I raced downstairs and saw that all the cases were no longer in the foyer and the rep wasn’t there either. I started to panic a little as we might not be able to get on the ship! I went outside and found the cases and the rep, luckily I found my case before they put it in the truck and recovered the passports and tickets.<br>
      The rest of the cruise was phenomenal, we visited Hiroshima, Busan in South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. In Vietnam Sarah fired an AK47, which she didn’t really enjoy, but did find a great gift for her brother. She found a bullet that had been converted into a lighter and some other things for her family, she loved getting people gifts.<br>
      We made some great friends on our dinner table (Pat and Marilyn), they became our travel buddies at every stop. They also treated us to Singapore Slings at Raffles when we were arrived in Singapore. We had a good few hours with them before we had to head to the airport to come home.<br>
      At the airport we got in line to go through security, this was done at the gate before you boarded the plane. I went through with no issues, I’m putting my belt back on when they ask Sarah to step to the side. The lighter she had got for her brother was in her hand luggage. We had to wait for 20 mins for the chief of security to get there and issue us with a formal warning. We had to sign documents that said if we ever went back to Singapore and committed any infraction we would be jailed.<br>
      This was the second time on this cruise where I lost my cool with Sarah. I said to her “If I get searched up the bum I’m going to kill you!”. They managed to finish the paperwork and stamp it 2 mins before they shut the doors for the flight. We got some really shitty looks from everyone on the flight back, but I didn’t care we were heading home and not to jail.<br>
      Greece and Venice<br>
      This was one of our least eventful cruises, with one exception, which didn’t involve Sarah or I. It was my mum, she was suffering from a painful shoulder and was on pain killers. One night the pain was really bad, so mum upped her pain relief to Codine. With the statement “Codine doesn’t have any affect on me!”. This wasn’t what we witnessed, at one point my mum was resting her face against the wall and slowly sliding down it. Sarah and I coined the name ‘Codine Val’ which we remembered fondly.<br>
      As ever Sarah had planned everything that we were to do on the couple of days we had in Venice after the cruise. We walked miles around all the back streets so she could see everything she wanted to. We even visited the Doge house which was slightly more interesting that it sounds. Sarah also found a lovely hello kitty phone case which was the highlight for her.<br>
      Christmas cruise with the nephews<br>
      Sarah really wanted to give some amazing memories to Freddie and Harry. So, she talked me into taking them on a cruise with us. She chose a Christmas cruise as that was a lot more special for them, than a normal cruise. It had five stops, 3 of which had Christmas Markets for us to explore.<br>
      This trip was everything Sarah could hope for, the boys had so much fun and fully embraced cruise life. I found Fred sitting in the buffet eating and ordering a drink, I asked him what he was doing and he said “I’m playing hide and seek, but I couldn’t find anyone so I came and got a burger!”, fair play. When I told Sarah that, she laughed and said that is what she wanted from this cruise.<br>
      The boys and I had an evening of sitting in the hot tubs on the open deck. All the jumping in and out of the hot water into the cold air took it’s toll on poor Harry. We were back in the cabin an Harry got a bad headache and was crying to go home. Sarah offered to buy him anything in the shop upto £50 or go to see the doctor, he chose the doctor, so she knew he wasn’t faking it.<br>
      It cost us about £100 for him to see the nurse and doctor but it was worth it when he came back all ready to go to the sportsplex and see his friends. Sarah was convinced that the boys knew the ship better than she did, if anyone knows about Sarah’s direction when on ship, that’s not difficult.<br>
      Our first night on the ship we got dressed and headed for dinner, Sarah wasn’t happy with the table as it was next to the staff entrance to the restaurant, which had a constant stream of people coming through it. Sarah, being Sarah, politely instructed the Matre’d to seat us somewhere else. Also, the food wasn’t up to it’s usual standards so several dishes went back. At the end of the meal Sarah gave the same Matre’d a detailed list of the problems we had, I told Fred that she was normally like this and it like nanny, was only happy when she was complaining. Fred relied with “It was like she was telling off a naughty school kid!”, I had to laugh at that one as normally it was me on the end of such a bollocking.<br>
      We spent most of the cruise eating in the Buffet, it was easier doing that with the kids. The only other time we went to the dining room for dinner was Formal night. The boys and Sarah looked amazing, they were so smart and got a lot of attention. I think everyone thought that their Grandad had paid for his daughter and kids to go on a cruise!!<br>
      The food was a lot better, Harry was shattered, so while we were waiting for our food he curled up on two chairs I had pushed together and was ‘recharging’ as he called it. He was in a white Tuxedo jacket and ordered spaghetti. We tucked two napkins around him whilst he ate, his head was so close to the bowl I thought he would fall asleep and faceplant into it.<br>
      Food was all he needed to recharge, once he was told he could go back to play with his friends he perked up no end.<br>
      To say I had reservations about this cruise was an understatement. But, I’m so happy Sarah talked me into it. I actually enjoyed it and the Boys were very well behaved. I’m glad they now have amazing memories of their Auntie Sa Sa. I also have amazing memories of how happy she was to give that to them. Right up to the end, she was planning to take them on more cruises and holidays. She loved them so much and was so proud to be their auntie.<br>
      Norway<br>
      Our last journey! It was amazing to have my whole family on this cruise too. Was almost the perfect trip, I so wish we had gone Yacht Club just so she could have experienced it (That is the one regret I have and really upsets me, that she never got to experience this. Having done it, she would have absolutely loved it. She was meant to be in there). Luckily, this trip to the Fjords was a bucket list trip for Sarah. Despite everything that was going on behind closed doors with her health, Sarah extracted every bit of enjoyment out of this trip.<br>
      Some of the amazing highlights of the trip was that our friends Jamie and Amy joined us, this was the man who said he would never go on a foreign holiday (Even though he hates Brexit). And the wonderful Flaam tour guides (Emily and Josh). It was the day of Jo’s (SIL) birthday, all of us at breakfast, waiting to be seated. Sarah took Jo’s presents to her and got told “No, I’m not doing this yet!”, someone was a little hungover.<br>
      We started breakfast and the tour guides presented us all with Flaam t-shirts. Then Jo was finally ready to have her presents. So that was done and we all got ready to go on the first Flaam tour, with Emily and Josh. It was a great tour and Sarah didn’t stop laughing all the way around. I also loved that trip, not just for the tour, but I spent the day with Ems and Josh doing a Bar Crawl around the ship. I had so much fun with them and got a lot closer to them. Sarah and I are so very proud of you both and everything you have and continue to achieve.<br>
      Germany<br>
      Sarah had a fascination with the second world war and Hitler and the Nazi’s she would watch documentaries and then tell me all about it. So, I wasn’t shocked when she told me that we were going to Nuremberg one December. It was for two reasons, one for us to go round the museum and the other was to experience a real German Christmas Market.<br>
      It was a wonderful trip that we both enjoyed and my secondary school German came into good use for order beer, but not much else. The market was amazing as we sampled everything it had to offer, beer, food, lights and entertainment. I say beer, I think Sarah put a big dent into the mulled wine stock levels.<br>
      The first museum we went to covered the rise of Hitlers Socialist Party and how he coerced, bullied and eliminated his rivals to gain power. It was fascinating and something I never would have done if I wasn’t with Sarah. She was always making me better that way.<br>
      The second museum was the Nuremburg museum, this showed how everything was controlled and also documented the Nuremburg trials. This again was fascinating and very humbling at the same time, how anyone can commit these types of atrocities is beyond me.<br>
      Our second trip to Germany was to Berlin, again Sarah had planned this with precision. We saw all the sights including Checkpoint Charlie, which was surprisingly easy to cross these days!! We also had coffee and cake in the Reichstag, we didn’t get to see Mrs Merkal, which was probably lucky for her!! We saw the Brandenburg gate and sampled a couple of drinking halls too.<br>
      But, the highlight of that trip, was discovering a hidden speak easy cocktail bar near our B&B. It looked closed, with blacked out windows, but, had a sign out the front saying ‘No Cards, only Drinkers!’. We had just got back to the apartment about 10pm and we saw someone ring the bell to this place. We watched as he was ushered inside and we caught a glimpse of leather sofas. Sarah rang the bell and a gentleman answered, after a couple of minutes of Sarah talking to him, he showed us in.<br>
      It turned out to be the owner of the bar, I can’t remember his name, but he told us that he had just got back from the USA where he had been competing in the cocktail world championship. It is actually a thing, I didn’t believe it at the time either. As some of you know, Sarah use to run the Circle bar in London and she became a cocktail making ninja. So a three hour cocktail making competition kicked off.<br>
      Unfortunately Sarah didn’t win, but I got shit faced as I had to try all the cocktails. It was a hard job but I got through it. The other good thing about it, was that he only charged us half of what we should have paid. Sarah always seemed to have a way of getting people to love her. She was one in a million.<br>
      Military Moves<br>
      During my service Sarah and I moved a lot at the start of our marriage, one of the most memorable moves was when we going from Northern Ireland to Hereford in 2013. For some reason it took a week for our possessions to get across, so we had to stay in a hotel for week.<br>
      We needed a hotel that took pets, as we didn’t want to leave the cats in the house, as this would have meant us having to return to the house to get the cats before getting the Ferry. For one night I stayed in the empty house with Frank as I was handing the house back in the morning.<br>
      Sarah had gone to the hotel with Pussa, so they had a whole night to themselves in the hotel. Sarah ordered a steak which they shared and Pussa decked himself out on the bed whilst I was on an inflatable mattress which deflated overnight!!<br>
      I still had a day at work, so wasn’t there for the fire alarm at the hotel. Apparently, the alarm went off, Sarah fought with Pussa to get him into the carrier and headed down to reception. Sarah stood there with Pussa crying from the carrier, by the time they got to head back to the room, all the staff had fallen in love with Pussa.<br>
      I really think Sarah preferred the night with Pussa to the rest of the week with Frank and myself there. 
  - chapter: 4
    title: Chapter 4 - Medical
    author: Martyn Fitzmaurice
    content: |
      Sarah’s medical history is a thing of legend now! She always said that it was my fault, there was nothing wrong with her until she met me. I think she was allergic to me, but she couldn’t resist being with me. This chapter I think is going to be the hardest for to write, as her health has dictated pretty much all of our marriage. I’ve seen far too many hospitals, travelled the country to speak with consultants, specialist and everyone else.<br>
      Sarah never wanted pity, she hated people feeling sorry for her. That’s why she made me promise not to tell anyone how sick she really was, until we really had too. We also, never asked the question about how long she had, it’s all guess work anyway, so we lived as much as we possibly could in that time.<br>
      I just can’t adjust to knowing that I will never hold her hand, rub her back and feet or kiss her on the forehead to make her feel better. Sit as the end of the bed, telling her jokes, being stupid to take her mind off what she was going through. Knowing she isn’t in any more pain is helpful, but what I wouldn’t give for just one more minute with her.  <br>
      Ankylosing Spondylitis<br>
      Sarah was diagnosed with AS less than a year into our marriage, this was triggered by the car accident she had where she broke her ankle. The trauma caused a gene in her DNA to change, which led to AS. AS is an arthritic disease that causes the body to attack itself. This would cause inflammation in her joints and her white blood cells would over react, building new bone at the effected joints.<br>
      It could be really painful, to alleviate the symptoms Sarah was put onto Immune Suppressing drugs. Initially this really helped, Sarah was out of pain, she was able to go to the gym and enjoy life again. For quite a while we had a great time with no problems at all. We were living in Northern Ireland at the time and decided to visit Sarah’s family.<br>
      Tuberculosis<br>
      As she hadn’t seen him in a while, Sarah’s brother came over to see her while we were back in Blighty. Little did we know that Marc had caught TB and in the 20mins he was with his sister, because of her low immunity, infected her with it too. Funny thing about this was that Sarah was unaware for a few days that she had caught it. So when we got back to NI, she went to the gym and a couple of classes. When she started to feel ill and Marc had got confirmation that he had TB. Sarah had to notify everyone in the classes and the Gym. The doc was shocked that she had the energy to do any phys at all.<br>
      Sarah had to come off the Immune Suppressants and start a mammoth drugs regime to get rid of the TB. At one point she was on 12 pills a day, she rattled when she walked around. This was my first taste of being on call to look after her. And is how the rest of her life went, with me always there to get her whatever she needed.<br>
      Sepsis<br>
      Sarah contracted Sepsis in July 2017, she had an open sore on her left breast that got infected and led to Sepsis. She ended up in hospital for two weeks on IVs. This was the first time I spent hours a day sitting with her in hospital, I never imagined that, that would become our lives for all the remaining years.<br>
      It was one of the hottest months of the year too, which didn’t help as the ward had sun on it all day and was the temperature of the sun. I don’t handle heat very well so was horrid for me, Sarah was asleep most of the time so it didn’t bother her and she likes the heat. I sat there for hours holding her hand and waiting for her to wake up, get that smile and watch her go back to sleep. It was always heart wrenching when I had to leave, she would give me the sad eyes and ask me to stay. If the Furkids had let me I would have stayed all night next to her.<br>
      Sarah got released the day before our wedding anniversary. We did nothing, got chinese and cuddled up on the sofa. Just so relieved that she was home, we didn’t really celebrate our anniversary, as it didn’t seem that important, with everything that was going on. We acknowledge that day and just got on with things.<br>
      Cellulitis<br>
      This happened in the winter of 2017, Sarah was admitted with an infection again and spent a 5 days in hospital, we spent New Years Eve sitting in A&E waiting to get admitted. Again, I spent hours in that hospital getting her things, bringing her clean underwear from home and generally trying to keep her moral up. This wasn’t as serious as the Sepsis, but it did keep her in bed for a week after she was discharged.<br>
      Gall stones<br>
      For years Sarah had suffered with abdominal pain, this was put down to IBS, allergies or whatever the doctor’s thought was right at the time. Finally, she was diagnosed with Gall Stones and they were going to remove her Gall bladder. She was admitted to hospital the day before her surgery as the pain was unbearable. The Doc was concerned that the pain wasn’t in the right place for the Gall Bladder, so ordered a camera down the throat to see what’s wrong.<br>
      I got a call from Sarah after she had woken up from the anesthetic. She said that they hadn’t done the procedure as they had found something in her stomach. They took a biopsy of the growth and waited for the results. Sarah was discharged and we went home, she was called by the nurse the following day and asked to come in the following day. I dropped Sarah off at the hospital and decided to shoot off and get some breakfast. She called me and told me to come back quickly. We sat in with the nurse and she delivered the news that Sarah had Cancer. She tried to explain what a GIST was, but we were in shock and didn’t really take a lot in.<br>
      If it hadn’t been for the Gall Bladder, we may have never discovered the GIST and she may have passed a lot sooner.<br>
      Gastro Intestinal Stomal Tumour (GIST)<br>
      Since the diagnosis we estimated that Sarah had between 2-5 years, this was just from what Sarah had researched online. We never asked the question until a month before she passed. Sarah didn’t want people to know how sick she was, as she hated being pitied and didn’t want to be treated any differently.<br>
      After the diagnosis Sarah was referred to Oncology at Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge. This was fortunate as that is where the UKs leading GIST consultant works. Dr B actually retired half way through her treatment, but stayed on part time just to treat her. The Support nurse Maddie was also amazing, we couldn’t have been in better hands.<br>
      The first consultation is a bit of a haze, there was so much information being thrown at us that it got a little confusing. The big piece of information we took away was that Sarah had a tumour growing out the side of her stomach, that when viewed on the imagery, was the size of her stomach. Sarah began the first of three targeted Chemotherapy tablets. The first 6 months on that gave her some good results, with the tumour shrinking. On the imaging, it looked like the tumour was dying and we had great hope that this would stop it.<br>
      Shortly after this good news, they changed her medication to a new generic drug. This wasn’t as affective so she was switched back to the original. I think this was the start of the decline, as it was working until the change. The Doc said that there was the rare mutation in the middle of the tumour that was missed by the several biopsies. So, it may not have mattered which meds she was on.<br>
      Over the next six months, the decision was taken that it was small enough for the surgeon to try and remove the tumour and hopefully save some of the stomach. During that time, Sarah’s tumour became unstable and ruptured several times. Resulting in multiple hospital stays, which I think is where we became as close as two people could get.<br>
      After the third rupture, the decision was taken to try and get the surgery moved up, this didn’t happen and in fact got pushed back a week, in that time the tumour ruptured again. This one tore a hole in her stomach lining and caused a massive infection in the stomach.<br>
      When she had her surgery, because of the multiple ruptures, they were unable to retain any of her stomach, so she had a full stomach removal. She was in surgery for nearly eight hours, the longest hours of my life. When the doctor called, I knew what he would say, so it wasn’t much of a shock.<br>
      Sarah didn’t want me to go and see her the day after the surgery so I went anyway, I wish I had listened! She was in post operation for 24hrs. I’ve never seen more tubes, wires and machines hooked up to one person before. It was very emotional, but I’m glad I did it, wouldn’t have been able to do anything that day otherwise. She woke up whilst I was there, and she told me off for coming.<br>
      The next day I was there on the dot for visiting hours, she still had a lot of tubes and wires attached to her, but she was sitting up in bed and in a good mood (She was on the good pain killers, as she said).<br>
      Recovering from the surgery took weeks for the physical and months to get back to some semblance of normal. For about ten days I was at the hospital every day, helping Sarah with her recovery. Slowly, walking further and further every day, starting to drink fluids, then purees and finally solids. She made such good progress that they let her go home after the ten days.<br>
      A day later we were back in hospital again, as Sarah couldn’t eat or drink anything. But, four days later, that was sorted and she finally came home for good. I was on my resettlement leave when the surgery took place, so I could spend all my time looking after her. Those months were amazing, I felt so close to her.<br>
      SIRT<br>
      About a year after her stomach removal Sarah got the news that micro tumours had appeared in her Liver and Spleen. They switched her Chemotherapy drug and that had some success in getting rid of the one in the Spleen and shrinking some of the Liver ones. Dr B came up with the idea of using SIRT radiotherapy to get rid of the remaining ones in the Liver.<br>
      Sarah was referred to Liverpool University Hospital and we went to see the consultant to see if Sarah would be a good candidate for the treatment. The consultant was very keen to do this as there had been some good results in other countries for this treatment on GISTs.<br>
      The only problem we faced was that it wasn’t a recognised treatment for GISTs as they are so rare. So to get the treatment Sarah and I had to pay for it. We could have scraped the money together and both families were willing to contribute. But, I came up with the idea of starting a Go Fund Me. We never expected the outpouring of support Sarah got, it was truly humbling.<br>
      Just went to show how loved Sarah was, a wholly selfless person who would go out of her way to help those she cared about. As well as those she didn’t know, so many times she either bought food for homeless people or more likely got me to do it whilst she carried on shopping.<br>
      As for the fund raising, it took off like a rocket! The target was smashed in just under 4 weeks, as they wanted to start the treatment within a few months of Sarah being accepted. There are far too many people to thank but I have some special mentions.<br>
      Wally and all the guys and girls at 42 Engr Regt, who held a fund raising day for us with a five a side football tournament and lots of other activities. 42 were suppose to have a game of football that day, so they forfeited the game and invited the other team down to be in the five a side. They also donated to the cause and published the event on their Instagram. This event raised over £1300, we couldn’t thank you enough.<br>
      There were some other big contributions, I will not name names but know you are all really appreciated and loved by me and the families.<br>
      The treatment was to be done in two stages, left side of the liver first, then the right. Sarah’s first treatment run happened in November 2023. We had to head to Liverpool for the treatment, we decided to try the train for the trial run of the procedure, bad choice!!<br>
      The journey up was ok, no real issues, apart from the age of the train on the second leg. But, it was the return journey that was a nightmare. Sarah’s procedure took longer than I expected so we couldn’t make the return train that I had planned on, luckily I had booked open returns.<br>
      We finally arrived at the station, Sarah was in a little bit of pain from the procedure, but was happy to be heading home. As soon as we got inside the station I saw that the next train had been cancelled and would be an hour wait for the next one. We found a quiet waiting room and snuggled up for the wait, 20mins later the next train was cancelled, followed by all the other trains on that route.<br>
      I managed to get us onto another train that went a different route, but was an hour longer. This journey was almost 4hrs, which wasn’t great for Sarah. We had also purchased first class tickets, so Sarah could have a bigger seat to get more comfortable. This train didn’t have a first class carriage, so we had to slum it with the riff raff.<br>
      When we finally got home, we agreed that we would never take the train again for that. So, a week later when we headed up for the procedure I was driving and Sarah was sleeping or on her phone. But, I have fond memories of us trying all the different services on the way and giving them scores out of 10. If you’re interested, Rugby services are best!! Lol<br>
      The first procedure took about 2hrs to do and then an overnight stay in a metal room for observation. As she got onto the ward late, they didn’t have any food she could eat. So, I had to go out to the shops and get her something to eat. She had a specific list so I got my steps in heading to lots of different shops to get her the exact things she wanted. Her little face made it all worth it as she sat up eating her little bed picnic.<br>
      The journey home was painless and there was a very happy Molly cat when Sarah was home. As Sarah was in bed for a couple of days recovering Molly was in heaven. I don’t think Molly came downstairs during that time, only to get some food then straight back upstairs.<br>
      The radiotherapy team had managed to fit in the treatment around our cruise with the nephews, as I type this it was a year today that we boarded the ship. So, much has happened in that year that it seems like 5 years ago.<br>
      The second session was in February 2024. This was a little more problematic, as Sarah was in A&E the night before the procedure with belly pain. They conducted scans and still did the procedure, that was when they found the tumour in her stomach bed. When I went to see her after the treatment she was feeling better as she had a nice cup of tea!! The on-call doctor came round to see us and let us know that they had discovered the tumour and that it was getting bigger.<br>
      When we got home the following day, we made an appointment to see Dr B to discuss this. We had to go through the whole weekend as we couldn’t get an appointment to see him until Tuesday, this was Friday. After seeing Dr B, he upped Sarah’s Chemo to see if that would have any effect.<br>
      GIST Tumour in stomach bed<br>
      The Chemo tablets she was on, initially had an effect and the tumours in her stomach had stopped growing, which was great news. It was such amazing news that we booked the cruise with my extended family to the Fjords. We thought that things were going the right way for her. How wrong we were.<br>
      After her next scan, it was apparent that this treatment wasn’t working as both of the tumours in her stomach bed had got a lot bigger, to the point it had filled the space left by her gastrectomy. They put her onto the final commercially available drug, this was a very high toxicity drug. Sarah really struggled on this and was constantly fighting the effects, pain and fatigue. It was a 4 week cycle of three weeks on the drugs and one week rest, this combined with a mixture of steroids, pain relief and other meds took it’s toll.<br>
      It was so bad that I had to take her to hospital several times, with it eventually being home nursing. I don’t think I had a full nights sleep in the last month of her life. It’s a horrendous feeling watching the person you love go through so much and not being able to take any of it away. I spent hours rubbing her feet and back to take her mind of the pain. Cooking several different meals because she didn’t know what she could handle that day.<br>
      Her final trip to the hospital was the worst. She was that weak that I had to pretty much carry her down the stairs to the car. She was almost bed bound at that point. But, through all of that only once did I see her resolve break and she said to me that she was done. Two minutes later she was back to fighting. She didn’t want to go to Peterborough hospital, as last time she was in there, they left her on a trolley in a corridor for several hours, as no one had told the nurses she had Stage 4 cancer.<br>
      So I took her to Cambridge which was where her cancer team were, so it made sense. Every day I would travel the two hours there and back to see her, because I hated the thought of her being alone. But, as per Sarah, she had made friends with all the ladies on the ward and was having tea and chats and playing games with them all.<br>
      The night before she passed, I left her about 8pm and she was really happy, as they thought she might be strong enough to come home on the Monday. The following morning the doctor called and said I need to make my way in. As it was in Cambridge I wasn’t able to get there in time to say goodbye. I don’t know if that’s a good or a bad thing. The doctor told me that when she started to go downhill, she asked Sarah if she wanted her to call me to come in. Sarah said no, as she didn’t want to disturb me, even at the end she was more worried about me than herself.<br>
      Sarah was a true fighter, in everything she did and I’m so lucky that she chose me to be her husband. You will always be in my heart my love and nothing will ever replace you.

      Tattoos<br>
      I wanted to write about all the other things about Sarah that don’t fall in the above chapters. So, this will be about her fads, her dress sense, her tattoos and us behind closed doors. When you think about Sarah the first thing you think is either tattoos or her style. This might surprise you all, but there was one point where I thought that we would split up. The only time we really fought and Sarah talked about getting her own place.<br>
      This argument was over tattoos and piercings, Sarah went on a mini binge of getting piercings in her ears and her bottom lip. A few more tattoos that I really didn’t like, so I stayed out late in the mess and came home and told her I didn’t like it (I was a drunken dick). We managed to get over this and that gave Sarah free reign to get loads more. Sarah also got her top lip pierced too, so it looked like someone had stapled her mouth shut. When this was pointed out, she removed both of them (I was happy about that).<br>
      Now she isn’t with us, her tattoos are one of the biggest things I miss, as they were so very Sarah. I loved telling people that the tattoo of her grandad on her shoulder was Sid James. When she first had it done, we went to our friend’s wedding, she had a shoulder less dress on and everyone was trying to figure out who it was. That was the start of me telling people it was Sid James.<br>
      My favourite tattoo was the pin up on her left arm, it was so skillfully done and looked like one you would have seen on the side of a WW2 Bomber. All of them were special to her, all had a story and were a reminder to her of something. The spools of thread on her right arm were for her Nan Beryl. The many Cat ones were for Pussa. But, none of them were for me, this was because Sarah was convinced that if she ever got one for me, we would break up. It was a strange superstition she had, which bothered me a little. I promised my mum I wouldn’t get a tattoo when I joined the Army, I might break that promise and get a reminder of Sarah permanently.<br>
      Style<br>
      Sarah’s style is now stuff of legend. The now famous pick shiffon dress with a matching blue jacket. All the trainers (Ever changing), the Simpson jacket, trainers, bag etc etc. It was always a delight to see what she would wear to formal nights on a cruise.<br>
      Then there was the Gucci fetish, this last year she totally went crazy for Gucci. Her Addidas collaboration bag, her furry shoes and brogues. The personal shopper (Yes) at Bicester Village replaced me as no.1 on Sarah’s speed dial!!<br>
      It became a weekly event of me having to drop whatever I was doing (normally work) and sit and give my comments on the recent purchases. These outfits ranged from fairly normal to totally out there (more this end of the spectrum). The excitement she had when showing me the outfits, I will be great at poker now, have the face down. My standard response to all the extravagance was “It’s very you!”. I thought that would be a good name for this book.<br>
      Her orders for clothes and trainers got that extreme that we got on first name terms with our delivery drivers. One of them showed me his GPS tracking and other than his home and work, our house was the next highest visited point. Sarah even got them Christmas presents to say thank you, she got them thermos flasks and a few other things for comfort in the car as they went round their deliveries. She was always thinking about other people and how she could make them happy.<br>
      Sarah’s Fad of the Week<br>
      I think the most exciting thing about living with Sarah, was the constant ‘fads’ she had. Sowing (Machine), knitting, accountancy (Was supposed to be her career, but became a hobby like the rest) and later on Lego (After years of abuse about me doing it). But, the biggest fad, that actually got us into a great place when I left the Army and bought Sarah’s extravagant clothes, was her Schuuting (a combination of Shite and tut) which she became a bargain hunter extraordinaire.<br>
      She really got into Auctions, Charity shops and car boot sales. I still have loads of books she got all about porcelain and crockery, every two weeks like clockwork after I finished on Friday we would head to the auction house for Sarah to go through the potential lots. I have to give her credit, she always made money. If there was a little gem in any of the boxes she would find it.<br>
      There was one time that Sarah had amassed so much ‘crap’, that I couldn’t get through the living room. I had to spend 30mins creating a walk way, just so we could get from one side to another. It made her so happy to do this, hunt for the bargins, then tell me at great length how much money she was going to make.<br>
      It became a well-oiled machine, Sarah would do all the research, buying, listing on Ebay and sorting the postage and collections out. I was the chief packer of things and head of distribution, both into and out of the house. It seemed to work well and was some of the happiest times I spent with her. When she found out that the postman would collect parcels from our house, he quickly became not so fond of those times.<br>
      Cats<br>
      As many of you know, Sarah was obsessed with cats, that wasn’t always the case, but through the majority of our life together we had cats and they are our children. Sarah always said she didn’t want to be the crazy cat lady, turns out we were the crazy cat couple!!<br>
      When we got married, Sarah wanted a dog. I made the argument that no matter what she promised me, I would end up looking after it. So, we settled on a cat, we were in Hermitage at the time and just down the road was a cat protection. Sarah and I had a look on the website and really liked the look of a little tabby girl. We went to have at her, but were told when we got there that she had been reserved. So, we then went into the pens and had a look at the other cats available. Half way down was Frank, he just looked at us and shouted. Sarah went into the pen to see him and fell for him. A house check later that day and Frank was living with us two days later. That was fourteen years ago and he’s still with me, a grumpy old man like me. Sarah didn’t like that he became my cat, but was happier later on when I found Puss.<br>
      About nine months after we were married, I got posted to Northern Ireland. Sarah and I went there kicking and screaming. But, we loved it over there and didn’t want to come back after the two years there. We came back with some amazing memories of NI and a new cat.<br>
      I was walking back to our house after a function at one of the bars on camp. I was a little bit tipsy, I’m not going to lie. When I heard a meow, I looked around and couldn’t find where it was coming from. Eventually I realised that it was coming from up a tree. In a suit and a little shaky I climbed up the tree and got a little tabby out the tree.<br>
      Thinking nothing of it, I headed back home. I got home, opened the door and looked behind me to see the cat had followed me back. I told Sarah, she got some food and put it out for him. I was about to head to bed, when Sarah looked out and the cat was just sitting there and the food had frozen over. So, she brought him into the house and setup a bed for him in the dining room.<br>
      The next morning we came down and thought that he would have headed out (We left a window open for him). What we found was him still there and the remains of a Dreamies bag he had destroyed to get to the treats. I found out that he was a neighbours cat and they had just left him when they moved out, apparently that happened a lot there.<br>
      I spoke to the local cat protection and they said that they had a waiting list of 6 weeks to take new cats in. That just so happens to be the right amount of time for a cat to acclimatise to a new home. We had been out shopping and I was putting it away, when Sarah shouted for me to go upstairs. When I got there Puss was curled up on our bed, Sarah turned to me and said “Guess he lives with us now”.<br>
      Puss became the cat Sarah had wanted, ultra needy and would just put up with forced cuddles. They were inseparable. In true Fitzmaurice cat tradition, Puss got fat, he was always begging for food, would destroy bags of treats to get them, steal food off your plate, sit on the side whilst you tried to make food. Sarah didn’t help him, as she was forever giving him treats, she even invented the ‘Catachino’. This was cat milk with squirty cream on top, Puss would go mental for them, Sarah also made me get him chicken nuggets and a milkshake for him from McDonalds. To say he was spoilt was a big understatement.<br>
      We sadly lost him to a short illness the same year Sarah was diagnosed. We did replace him with Molly, but I will talk about her later.<br>
      All of our cats are either rescues or rehomed, we got Giz from Sarah’s sister Rachel, due to a second case of pregnancy. She is the most skittish of the cats and she will attack without warning. Sarah lovingly referred to her as the bitch cat. She became my cat and would every now and again let Sarah fuss her. Sarah also called her ‘Hypogiz’, this was after Buckbeak (the hypogriff) from Harry Potter. For Sarah to fuss her, she would have to slowly approach Giz and ask if she could fuss her, if Giz bowed her head, she would let Sarah fuss her, if not she would get attacked.<br>
      Next we got Boo, I say we, I had no choice in it what so ever. I had been posted to Wyton and we were waiting for an accessible house for Sarah, so I lived there during the week and Sarah was still in Hermitage. I was on exercise and Sarah called me to enquire about getting another cat!! Which would be number 4. I said that I’m not having anything to do with this decision! If she wanted a forth cat it would be her responsibility.<br>
      She chose to get Boo and so we had four cats. Boo was very shy, so Sarah forced her to endure fuss, as she inflicted on all our cats. After a few days of this enforced fuss Boo relented and became a Fitzmaurice cat. As she is a long-haired cat, who hates being brushed, Sarah would shave her in the summer. As Boo was a wriggler the haircuts were a little extreme and made her look like she had a fight with a lawn mower.<br>
      After Pussa passed, Sarah needed another needy cat to replace him. We got Molly and she filled the hole that Pussa left. Sarah molded her into the fuss obsessed cat Pussa was, Molly was a constant companion for Sarah when I was working or out. She wouldn’t leave Sarah alone and I was really thankful for that. I was worried Molly would struggle after Sarah passed, but she has adapted well and now spends many hours a day laying on my shoulders for fuss!<br>
      Then there were all the stray cats, these were either ones Sarah picked up when we moved or the random ones on the street. It was a standing joke between us that every time Sarah saw a cat she would say “You want to come and live with us?”. If we could have afforded it and had the space, she would have collected them all, like pokemon.<br>
      Our first stray encounter was at Hereford, in a small building near our house was a big street cat that Sarah called ‘Scrags’ as he was really scraggy from living on the streets for so long. He would often come into our house and eat our cats food. Sarah wanted to try and catch him so we could take him to cats protection. When he came in, Sarah closed the window behind him so he was trapped in the kitchen.<br>
      Scrags went mental, trying to get out of any window or door, glasses and plates went flying and the shouts and hissing was crazy. I managed to open a window and Scrags flew out. We got in contact with cats protection and they came and caught him, he was rehomed within in a couple of weeks and was really happy.<br>
      We were living in Lincoln and a cat would turn up to our house every day. It was a small black cat I called ‘Beans’, so we had Frank and Beans. We thought it was a stray, but it had a collar and we found out it was from a house a few doors down. Sarah went round to let them know that Beans was at ours. The owner thought that she was just an outdoors cat, not realising that Beans had been in our house for the past 2 days. We had to stop her from coming in the house, so Sarah closed all the doors and windows. Beans walked around the house screaming to be let in, this went on for four days, finally she gave up and luckily we got posted shortly after that.<br>
      Sarah would always invite any stray cat in the area near our house to come and stay with us, always leaving food out for them and fussing them. What she didn’t realise, was this was a problem for Frank, as he had to protect her, so he would fight with any Cat that went too close to Sarah. He even chased some poor person on their bike as they got too close to the house.<br>
      When Rach and Fred came to see us in Hermitage, Sarah took Fred to the park close to our house. Frank followed then to protect Fred and didn’t leave his side when Fred was playing in the park. Not too bad for a shitbag, Frank that is, not Fred.<br>
      These cats are our children and Sarah was the crazy cat mum that they all needed. They and I really miss Sarah.<br>
      Simpsons<br>
      Sarah was a massive Simpsons fan, ever since she was a child. She would recite episodes word for word to me and pretty much knew what episode it was from the first few seconds after the credits. She told me that her and her brother would watch boxset after boxset. Her obsession with it went beyond just the show, everyone should be aware of her Simpsons attire.<br>
      Her prized Simpson clothing were, the Bart Simpson denim jacket, the Homer Simpson trainers and the Bart Simpson jumper. When Disney plus was announced I said to Sarah that I was going to get it, she told me ‘no’ that we couldn’t afford it. When she found out that every Simpson episode was on it, we found the money from somewhere!<br>
      Serial Killers<br>
      Again, this was another of her passions and obsessions. She would spend hours either reading about then, or watching documentaries or series of any serial killer. Her head was full of random facts about them, which she would always like to tell me about. As I didn’t really care I would just nod and pretend to listen.<br>
      Another obsession related to this was true crime documentaries and series, but I think she got that from her dad Terry. That was something they bonded over and I loved how close they were. I haven’t, at the time of writing, taken Sarah’s profile off of Netflix. I sometimes just scroll through what I think she would have been watching if she was still here.<br>
      I see programs, books and movies I know she wanted to see and would have wanted to see. A constant reminder of how passionate about things she was and how infectious that was for people around her.<br>
      Food<br>
      When I first met Sarah, she was what I would call a food snob. The chicken had to be free range and corn fed as it tasted so much better. Water had to be filtered as it tasted better (She was from London, so that makes sense). She would insist on going to decent (Expensive) restaurants, mainly seafood as she loved seafood.<br>
      It worked between us, as I dragged her standards down and she raised mine up, so we met somewhere in the middle. I was taking her to Nando’s (Which she hated) and KFC as that was more in our price range.<br>
      But the past few years, Sarah’s continued passion for fine dining has rubbed off on me, we have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the country, wish we could have done more together as I loved watching her discovering new things. How excited she got at the prospect of a new restaurant. I think there have been three standout places we have eaten.<br>
      Danesfield House in Marlow was the first, we knew the head chef and when I got back from Afghanistan, Sarah had arranged for us to have lunch there, her treat. It was supposed to be my day, but as soon as Sarah had taken a sip of her champagne, I was the designated driver! The food was amazing and we went there several times after that for our anniversary.<br>
      The next is Man behind the Curtain in Leeds, as avid foodies we watched the Great British Menu and we saw this rockstar chef on there Michael O’Hare. His fish dish won and we knew we had to go and try the menu. Sarah arranged this as a birthday present for me and we travelled up to Leeds from Newbury. We hit every bit of traffic going and we were almost late to our reservation.<br>
      The food again was amazing, apart from the raw langoustine. It was like a work of art on every plate and they had the signature dish that won GBM. That was the best fish and chips I’ve ever had, if I think hard enough I can still remember it. To make it even better, the lady at the table next to us asked if Micheal was in. The waitress said he was and would see if he was available. We didn’t think much of it, he came over and spoke to them for a couple of minutes, then turned round and had a chat with us. As per normal, I was a little star struck and waffled a bit about the food and what his inspirations were. Turns out he taught himself to cook at Uni as the food was awful. He must have chatted with us for about 20 mins, think he was trying to impress Sarah.<br>
      And finally, the have Midsummer House in Cambridge. When we moved into our new house there were a few teething problems. The aftersales rep was a little lackluster and Sarah made a few complaints (she was so happy). It turns out that he had got a lot of complaints, so he called us to reassure us that everything would be sorted and as a way of apology they would treat us to a dinner.<br>
      I suggested to Sarah Midsummer House, it was expensive so we checked with the rep, in fact we checked about five times, he said no limit. So we booked it and went, had a couple of glasses of champagne, Sarah bought the cookbook thinking that we would pay for that. Then we submitted the bill to the new rep as the other one had been asked to leave.<br>
      They paid for everything, which obviously made it taste so much better! I can only describe the whole thing as a gastronomic dining experience. The service was amazing and the food was out of this world. Sarah adored it and was already planning the next visit, as they have seasonal changes to the menu.<br>
      We didn’t manage to get there for the winter menu as Sarah was going through her radiotherapy. But, I did take her back for her last birthday. I booked it online, thinking it was on deal. It wasn’t so I said to Sarah I would cancel it, she said no. She just wanted to do as much as she could so we went. This experience was just as good as the first. The Maitre’d remembered Sarah (no surprise) and we had a lovely meal.<br>
      We had a great table, with a view into the kitchen, every now and again we would see the chef walk around. Sarah mentioned to the waitress that I was a big fan. Two minutes later, she asked if we would like to go into the kitchen!! That was an amazing experience for us both, we chatted with the chef and watched our desserts being made. Again, Sarah making things happen for me as she always did. Just one of a thousand things I will miss about her.

    author: Martyn Fitzmaurice

      Sarah’s work career is fairly wide spread, she ran a bar, worked in accounts, worked for the Queens household and became a policy guru in the passport office. When we got married, Sarah told me that she will carry on studying to be an accountant and when I retire from the Army I could be a husband of leisure. This didn’t come to fruition, due to Sarah having a massive career U-turn and deciding that she really didn’t like accounts.<br>
      It worked out well, I got a great job after leaving and we were able to enjoy our last few years together.<br>
      Capita<br>
      When I first met Sarah, she was working at Capita. I know for a fact that she really didn’t like the job or the company, but she loved the people she worked with. And in true Sarah fashion formed solid friendships that stood the test of time and me taking her away from everyone.<br>
      Sarah was made redundant from Capita, she told me over a satellite phone as I was in Kenya with the Army. It actually worked out fairly well for us, as we were married shortly after that. We were able to move to our first posting in Hermitage without any issues with the job.<br>
      I’m sure there are some wonderful stories of her time at Capita, I’m just waiting for the gang to share them with us.<br>
      Buckingham Palace<br>
      During our second time at Hermitage as a married couple Sarah saw a job for a purchase ledger at Buckingham Palace. She applied not thinking anything would come of it, but was called forward for an interview. This went well and after a couple of weeks, she got a call for Buckingham Palace HR offering her the job. She jumped at it and had to commute in everyday, sometimes this was a pain from Hermitage so she would stay at her mums.<br>
      As she was on immune suppressants for her AS, she managed to always get colds travelling on the underground. A perk of working for the Queen, she had use of the Royal Apothecary (Doctor) and would get prescriptions with Royal Apothecary on it. The only problem with that, is that is cost £16 to get the prescription filled.<br>
      Sarah didn’t get on well with her line manager. As she was trying to bring more modern accounting techniques, Sarah was told on several occasions that ‘it had always been done that way at the Palace’. This didn’t go down well as Sarah made her look incompetent on more than one occasion. To that end, when it came to the end of her probation the line manager ensured that Sarah was not retained. I told her to take her to a tribunal, but she didn’t want to so that closed that chapter in her life. <br>
      Passport Office<br>
      As much as Sarah complained about people not following policy she loved doing this job. Affectionately known as the ‘policy queen’ she knew it inside and out. Every evening I would be given an update on policy and how it should be used and what act it was under. Her attention to detail was exceptional and her enthusiasm was just as big.<br>
      Another thing that made her love her job was her line manager Steve. One of the nicest people I’ve ever come across and a great support to Sarah during the last few years. With Steve in her corner Sarah never had to worry about missing some days of work due to illness. That helped her so much as she could concentrate on getting better and getting over treatment.

    title: Martyn's Stories
    author: Martyn Fitzmaurice
    content: |
      <b>Another great lap dancing story</b> was when we met up at with some of the guys who worked for me. Meeting up with them in Covent Garden we decided to go to Stringfellows, as it was free to get in with an Army ID. We headed there and whilst in there a dancer started chatting to the guys. I started to spin a ‘dit’ about them just getting back from Afghan and could they have a free dance. This was shot down so we decided to go to another club instead.<br>
      Whilst at this club, I went to get us some drinks. When I got back, I saw the guys heading in to get dances and Sarah was paying for them. I asked her “Why are you buying the dances?”, to which she replies “They’ve just got back from Afghan!”. “No, they haven’t! I was just trying to get them a free dance!”. Sarah looked me straight in the face and said “Well, it worked, they have got free dances!”. From that point I (Sarah) reached legendary status. Which continued throughout our lives together, she was always making me better.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sarah’s sense of humour.</b> For years when I took my clothes off I would ask Sarah if she ‘Saw anything she liked?’. The last time I did that she looked at me and said “No, all I see is ‘hairy’ Dog Tits!”. She was always making me proper belly laugh, I miss that so much. Aswell as missing making her laugh when she was really ill.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Meeting Northampton Saints in Dublin.</b> When Sarah and I were based in Northern Ireland we went to Dublin with our friends to watch Ireland v England in a pre-world cup rugby match. At the same time we were there, Northampton Saints (my fav rugby team) were staying in the same hotel we were in. I was like a kid, but too shy to go and speak to any of them.<br>
      We got back to the hotel after a long day in Dublin and decided to have a couple of drinks in the bar before heading to bed. In the bar was Jim Mallander (Saint head coach), a few other coaches and Dusty Hare (Academy Director and rugby legend). Again, I was too shy to go and talk to them and went to the toilet. When I returned Sarah nodded at Jim Mallander and he came over to have a chat, she always went out the way to do wonderful things for me.<br>
      After I had finished having a chat with Jim, I sat back down with Sarah and she told me the story of how she got Jim to come over. It turns out that as soon as I left, she went straight over to him and asked “Are you Jim Allison?”, He replied “Close enough!”. She then proceeded to instruct him that when she nodded, he was to come over and introduce himself.<br>
      We carried on having our drinks and Sarah asked me if there was anyone else I would like to talk too. I said Dusty Hare, she looked at me like I was crazy and said “Why that old bloke!”. After I explained that he was a legend, she grabbed my arm and dragged me up to bar to talk to him. She kept calling him Bucky (as in the Captain Bucky O’Hare cartoon). She even got him to do an autograph for my dad. I’ve said this many times, her amazing personality just drew people in and made them love her. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Easter Egg Scandal.</b> Right at the start of our relationship, Sarah was living with her mum in Beckton. It was coming up to Easter and Anne had got me a Whispa easter egg. It sat on top of the fridge waiting for my next visit. When I finally got there and received my egg I found that the back of the egg had been eaten. Sarah and her brother had been taking little bits from the back, so it looked like it was still whole. I told Sarah that she needed to buy me a new egg. She never did!! As I’m writing this, it’s coming up to easter! I can’t look at a Whispa egg without remembering this story. You still owe me an egg babe.

      <b>The East End 'Pie and Mash up' (more like fuck up).</b> After seeing it on Facebook, we decided to attend an east end pie and mash themed event. £50 ticket, a free portion pie and mash and a drink from well-known east end pie/mash places. Live music, bars...all that sort of stuff, held somewhere in south London of all places. Two event times: 11 am or 4pm on a Sunday.<br>
      We go the 4pm, thinking would be more lively and run into the night. Get there at 5ish, place is empty. Go to get some drinks, options are low, Sarah wanted a cocktail, they weren't serving cocktails. So right away, she isn’t happy. Has something like a wine served in a plastic pint glass. None of the pie mash stools were well known...more like mock up gastro ones. (We found out after that none of the well-known places like Robins or Muareens would go anywhere near the event when asked).<br>
      The 'Live Music' was pearly king and queen in their 80's singing Chas and Dave, knees up mother brown and other east end rhymes. We are sitting there on a garden sofa like a pair of idiots getting a private performance. It was so cringy and embarrassing.<br>
      So we decide to have our pie and mash. Guess what....there wasn't any left it was all sold out at every vender.<br>
      Sarah: "Sold out?! What you mean sold out? We are the only ones here!<br>
      Vender: "Sold out from the earlier event"<br>
      Sarah: "You mean to say you haven’t stocked up enough for two events, We have paid £50 each for a f'cking wine in a pint cup and to listen to this rubbish'<br>
      We sat back down and by now Sarah is absolutely fuming...I mean livid, its the only thing she is talking about, how much of a sham it is...a big con etc. Which is only feeding me fuel to wind her up more. <br>
      So we decided to leave....I don't think we even lasted an hour! It was terrible! It took longer to get there.<br>
      On way out Sarah complained and later sent an email to the organisers.....a few days later...we got refunds. <br>
      It was defo one of those thing that was so bad, you can’t help but laugh about it when looking back. 🤣🤣🤣<br>
      <br>
      <b>The (not so) Dippy Eggs.</b> That Sarah came to visit one weekend, I decided to take her the regular greasy spoon cafe I went for breakfast. I have the fry up, Sarah has the dippy eggs. Halfway thru eating, the woman behind counter comes round and asks, "everything ok?"<br>
      Me: "Yes thanks, it's lovely"<br>
      Sarah: "No, not really, my eggs aren't dippy, more like hardboiled egg, its cold and my toast isn't very toasted"<br>
      The poor cow looked like she wished she hadn’t asked. Offer her a replacement, but Sarah declined. Gotta love her out right honesty 🤣<br>
      5 years on...I still haven't had the courage to returned to that cafe. 😳🤣<br>
      <br>
      <b>The New Shoes.</b> Right before you guys met, we were out in Romford for a small school reunion. Sarah had these brand spanking new and expensive heels/ Shoes that she hadn't broken in yet. As night went on, we and a couple of our friends, decide to couple go a club. Sarah is complaining about her shoes and dances without them.<br>
      When its time to go, she is moaning and complaining that she can’t walk in her shoes. We have to walk about 1/4 mile the cheapest cab office. So, I decide to try and give her a piggy back, which failed miserable and ended up with us both on floor as we were pissed. So I gave her the loafers I was wearing. Problem was, I had no socks on. Sarah was now shuffling in my size 10 loafers and I was walking bare foot thru Romford at 3am carrying her heels.<br>
      We looked ridiculous!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ginger Monkey.</b> Sarah came with me and Callum to Colchester Zoo. When going thru one of the enclosures on a train, the tour guide points out that the Red Lemar Monkeys were born the colour they are, so that their parents would not forget to look after them. Callum, 5 at the time shouts, "is that why your ginger Sarah, so your mum won't forget to look after you?<br>
      I was laughing, Sarah was laughing and the people around us was laughing...the timing was spot on. After we got off the train, Sarah asked if I had told Callum to say that which I hadn't. To this day, every now and then I would call Sarah a ginger monkey and remind her of that.

      One of the kazillion things I loved about Sarah.<br>
      During the early part of the covid pandemic, when everyone was so isolated and stressed, Sarah tried to make our lives here more exciting (And succeeded).<br>
      I got the impression very early on when I first met Sarah that she was special. She would go out of her way to do something kind. And during 2020 when things were really weird, she took time to make up, and post to us, a big box of activities for Amber to do whilst we were unable to socialise.<br>
      So, whilst we were trying and failing to do much of the home schooling, we had a fun time with Sarah’s stuff. We planted sunflower seeds and watched them grow, we made placemats and bunting and coloured pictures on a huge tablecloth sized piece of paper.<br>
      Sarah really helped me during that horrible time. She was so kind to Amber and was adored back in return. She brought light into those dark days x
